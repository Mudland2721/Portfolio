            <h1>Hello! I Hope This Finds You In Good Health!</h1>
            <strong>
                <p>
                    My name is Mason Morey! In these recent times I have been learning how to become a web developer. I
                    have
                    had a passion for getting my hands on the fabric that makes things like applications and video games
                    work. Since I was little I have always found joy in playing a video game and later after the story
                    has
                    been played through, find out what codes I could use to alter the game and how you play it. I have
                    played quite a few Bethesda games and found online how to give myself more money or how to boost my
                    states. I later found myself looking at web development as a profession after hearing about a family
                    member that got a job in the field. I thought to myself creating a webpage and other applications
                    must
                    be similar in someway or anther and began my road down the web devs path.
                </p>

                <p>

                    I have sent just about the whole year trying to perfect what I can do with code. And strive to learn
                    other better ways of of building, and am always willing to take a look at what I can improve upon.

                </p>

                <p>
                    In any workplace setting workplace corporation plays a huge part in a companies work machine. And
                    while
                    going down this road to become a web developer I have never seen how important teamwork and
                    collaboration is to this field. The amount of moving parts in modern day applications is quite
                    amazing
                    and its traditionally done by a team of developers. I cannot wait to meet and work with other
                    developers
                    and learn from them on how I can be building more efficiently and accurately. Knowledge and an
                    improved
                    streamlined ways of tackling a citation is always good to have in the toolbox. Providing and
                    discovering
                    new way to handle problems is something I cannot wait to get started doing.
